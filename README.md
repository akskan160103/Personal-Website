# Personal Website

## Overview

This is my personal website designed using React.js. It features four distinct sections, a responsive navbar, and an interactive social media links bar. This project focuses on delivering a clean, easy-to-navigate user experience with reusable components.

## Features

### Four Distinct Sections
- The website is organized into four different sections, making use of React.js to create highly organized and reusable components.
    - **Header** - Contains all my social media links: Github, Linkedin, and instagram.
    - **About** - Contains a brief insight into my background, education, hobbies etc.
    - **Experience** - Contains my experiences and projects that I've worked on.
    - **Contact** - Contains information on how to reach out to me through my email and WhatsApp. 

### Responsive Navbar
- The navigation bar is responsive and provides immediate visual feedback during navigation. This is implemented using React's `useState` hook.

### Emphasized UI/UX Principles
- Advanced CSS selectors are used to enhance user interactions, particularly with a social media links bar that's designed to be engaging and intuitive.

## Project Status
### Deployment
- The website is deployed using Vercel and **is accessible** at **[akshaykannan.com](https://akshaykannan.com)**
### Current Limitations
- The website is currently optimized for laptop screen sizes and may not display as intended on other devices.
- **Note**: I am actively working on modifying the website to be fully responsive across various screen sizes.

## Future Plans

- Full responsiveness for tablet and mobile sizes.
- Additional features to be determined based on user feedback.
